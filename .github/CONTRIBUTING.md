### Your First Code Contribution

> ðŸ’¡ Remember that nc_tg_bot is built on top of [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram) and [nc_py_api](https://github.com/cloud-py-api/nc_py_api) libraries, so integrating new features with these libraries is pretty easy.

1. `Fork` this repository
2. Create a `branch`
3. `Clone` your nc_tg_bot fork.
4. Set current working dir to the root folder of cloned nc_tg_bot.
```bash
cd nc_tg_bot
```
5. Install dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org "python package manager"):
```bash
poetry install
```
6. Create and edit .env file:
```bash
cp .env.exmaple .env
vi .env
```
7. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
8. Run bot:
  - With docker compose:
    ```bash
    make bot-build
    make bot-run
    ```

    * Make migrations:
    ```bash
    make migrate
    ```
    * Run bot:

poetry run python -m pytest
```
